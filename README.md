# Secure Client-Server Messaging System

## Steps to run      
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt      
- Open a terminal and run "python3 server.py"      
- Open another terminal and run "python3 client.py"    

## Communication between Client and Server
- Either client or server must send a message to continue conversation, an empty message or a message containing illegal characters (characters other than alphanumeric or white spaces) would cause the communication to terminate immediately
- Exit the conversation by typing "exit" in client terminal
